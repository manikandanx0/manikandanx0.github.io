We use the internet everyday. From shopping to scrolling cat videos, the internet has become part of our lives.

As Computer majors we must learn and understand the tech that we use and the greatness behind it.

But what is a network protocol?

## Protocol:

In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. _[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/)_

Protocols simply define how data is transfered between network nodes. We use these protocols on a day-to-day basis without considering them.

## 1. TCP/IP Protocol

This is the most important and often the most confusing protocol suite to understand.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a protocol suite that forms the fundamental framework for internet communication, enabling standardized data transmission.

It defines the standards and rules for how data is packaged, addressed, transmitted, and received across networks. While the OSI model serves as a theoretical reference, TCP/IP is the practical standard that actually powers the internetâ€”today, almost all network devices and internet communications operate based on the TCP/IP protocol suite.
